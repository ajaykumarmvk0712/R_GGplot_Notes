# R_GGplot_Notes

This repo is just my attemp to practise using `ggplot`
I will try to alos upload notes which explain 
the underlying grammar. I am referring to Hadley Wickham's
book for this. 

The themes chapter needs updates as it references some
functions which are now updated.

Feel free to browse this repo. Let me know in case you
want to give me feedback. You can reach me at ajaykumarmvk@gmail.com.
